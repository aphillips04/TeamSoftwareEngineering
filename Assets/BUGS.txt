currently the tool raycast sees the alien no matter where you look for some reason


I *think* the rotation on the alien is gonna fuck with the navmeshagent - not sure yet

On a separate note -- we need a better way to check what raycasts hit so we don't get null references when they hit nothing / something that doesn't interact in the right way
